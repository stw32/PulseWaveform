Description: PulseWaveform provides functions useful for the processing of 
    Photoplethymography (PPG) data in R, including pre-processing, beat segmentation,
    amplitude scaling, fiducial point detection, morphological feature extraction, 
    and decomposition modeling using a Nelder-Mead downhill simplex optimisation method.
